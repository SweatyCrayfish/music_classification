## Introduction

This project aims to classify music into various genres and identify the composer using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Data Loading

Data for this project is loaded using custom Python scripts.

## Data Exploration

Data exploration is performed to understand the distribution and characteristics of the music data.

## Feature Extraction

Features are extracted from the music files using Fourier Transforms and other techniques.

Feature Vector = FFT(Audio Signal)

## Model Building

A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
